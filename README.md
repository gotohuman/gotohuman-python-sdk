# gotoHuman - Human in the Loop for AI workflows

[gotoHuman](https://gotohuman.com) helps you build production-ready AI workflows by making it really easy to include human approvals. Keep a human in the loop to review AIâ€‘generated content, approve critical actions or provide input.

Set up a fully customized review step capturing any relevant data (text, images, markdown,...) and required human input (buttons, checkboxes, inputs,...). Then trigger it from your application whenever human review from your team is needed.

[Read the docs](https://docs.gotohuman.com/send-requests) on how to send requests for human review with our Python SDK.
